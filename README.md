## Questions
1. Can we predict a smoker based on certain variables? 
2. What are the top variables which attribute to a smoker vs non smoker? 
3. What health problems may be a factor from smoking?


## Dataset Sources

## A description of the data exploration phase of the project



## A description of the analysis phase of the project
- Why did you choose this model?
- How will you train the model?
- Whatâ€™s the accuracy of the model?
- How does the model work?
- If statistics are involved, which ones will the analysis include, and why?
- What would you include or change if you had more time?


## Project Setbacks/Lessons
- Intial dataset we wanted to use [COVID19-Dataset-with-100-World-Countries](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sambelkacem/covid19-algeria-and-world-dataset) would not work for machine learning because it had too many variables with repeating values (ie. the population variable would not change, even though it is a continuous vaule and deaths should attribute to it). What we learned is the exploritory process of the data, and knowing what models you plan to use with it, are an essential beginning part of the process.
