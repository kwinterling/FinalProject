## Questions
1. Can we predict a smoker based on certain variables? 
2. What are the top variables which attribute to a smoker vs non smoker? 
3. What health problems may be a factor from smoking?

## A description of the data exploration phase of the project



## Database Creation
Many datasets were reviewed in the hopes of locating information that could tell a story about the overall health of smokers versus non-smokers. The robust set of quantitative data found in the Smokers Status Prediction dataset posted to Kaggle by Guarav Dutta offers the potential for the use of various machine learning algorithms to train and classify the data. Identifying which health markers contribute the most to a smoker's overall health and/or lifespan will be the desired outcome of this effort. 

After sourcing from Kaggle, the dataset underwent an inital cleaning and was then ready for import into a database. It was decided that the generic patient data, such as height and weight measurements, would be split into a table of their own. Data for the machine learning approach was to be held separately, but linked to to an individual's measurements via an ID number designated as the primary key.

The below image illustrates the connection between the two tables and offers insight to the datatype and formatting. This information would be useful in an attempt to query this data.

Below, a basic filtered query of the dataset can be seen. All rows were successfully uploaded and datatypes conform to dataset structure.

### Smoking - Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier:

### Smoking - Balanced Random Forest Classifier:

![ Supervised_ML_Images/Smoking-Balanced_Random_Forest_Classifier](Supervised_ML_Images/Smoking-Balanced_Random_Forest_Classifier.png)
* Accuracy of around 79%, precision of 80% and recall of 77% is achieved by using Balanced Random Forest Classifier. Hence Balanced Random Forest Classifier is best suited method for our ML model. 

## Optimizing the Balanced Random Forest Classifier:

***Optimizing the Balanced Random Forest Classifier led to having Accuracy of around 80%, precision of 81%, recall of 78% and specificity of 82%. Hence with Balanced Random Forest Classifier our ML model is able to predict with 80% accuracy.***

## Project Setbacks/Lessons
- Intial dataset we wanted to use [COVID19-Dataset-with-100-World-Countries](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sambelkacem/covid19-algeria-and-world-dataset) would not work for machine learning because it had too many variables with repeating values (ie. the population variable would not change, even though it is a continuous vaule and deaths should attribute to it). What we learned is the exploritory process of the data, and knowing what models you plan to use with it, are an essential beginning part of the process.
